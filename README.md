# DaibaPark_CreativeBehaviorEvents
The categorized verbal protocol data from a study of 30 participants in a treasure hunt experiment conducted a physical and a digitally replica of Daiba Park. The dataset supports the findings presented in the paper:  "Perceiving Virtual Affordances: A Comparative Study of Users’ Creative Behaviors in Physical and Immersive Virtual Environments"
# Daiba Park Treasure Hunt: Categorized Verbal Protocols

## Overview
This repository contains the .csv dataset of categorized verbal protocols for the study **"Perceiving Virtual Affordances: A Comparative Study of Users’ Creative Behaviors in Physical and Immersive Virtual Environments"**.
Participant verbalizations were recorded, transcribed, and systematically coded to identify and categorize creative behaviors. each .csv file contains a table of Verbal protocols (VP), its BDI category, the creative behavior indicator assigned -which in case of it being (Affordance) the type of affordance is provided as (Deny or Affirm). and the creative behavior type.


The data originates from an experiment where 30 participants completed a treasure hunt task in two environments:
1. **Physical Space (PS)**: The physical Daiba Park.
2. **Immersive Virtual Environment (IVE)**: A high-fidelity virtual replica of the same park.

Each file contains data from one group of 10 participants. the groups are seperated based on the location and creative background as follows:
1. **PS Non-Specialized**: Physical Daiba Park, No formal creative training
2. **IVE Specialized**: Virtual Daiba Park, With professional creative training
3. **IVE Non-Specialized**: Virtual Daiba Park, No formal creative training

## Creative Behavior Taxonomy

Verbalizations were categorized into the following creative behavior (CB) types:
1.  **Mental CB**: A change in belief about the environment.
2.  **Bodily CB**: A motor movement independent of environmental constraints.
3.  **Physical CB**: The implementation of a change by moving objects.
4.  **Conceptual CB**: The belief that content should be instantaneously edited or added.
5.  **Constructional CB**: The attempt to create a new object or space.
